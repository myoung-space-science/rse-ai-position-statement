# Position Statement on Generative AI in the RSE Workplace

## Preamble
Research software engineering – building and maintaining software to enhance research – is an indispensable part of modern research. Since computing entered the research toolkit, Research Software Engineers (RSEs) have been integral to research across disciplines through the software and infrastructure they build and maintain.

The role of RSEs spans a broad spectrum, from supporting individual research labs to inter-institutional collaborations. As universities move rapidly to integrate Generative AI (GenAI) into their operations, RSEs are increasingly responsible not only for using these tools but also for incorporating them into institutional and research infrastructure.

With the recent rapid emergence of GenAI, the conversation around software engineering in the age of GenAI has too often been focused on AI hype and/or dystopian futures predicting the demise of software engineers. This has left relatively little space for nuanced discussions around this topic and the complexities of developing research software in a future where GenAI is widely available.

The Alliance for Data Science and AI (ADSA) and the US Research Software Engineer Association (US-RSE) received joint funding from Schmidt Sciences to solicit information from RSEs. Over a four-month period in 2025, more than 200 RSEs gathered to discuss the state of GenAI in the RSE workplace. These gatherings (at SciPy, RSECon 25, US-RSE 2025, Supercomputing 2025) allowed RSEs to discuss the impacts of GenAI on the work of research software engineering. Through these conversations, the RSE community has determined to create this public statement on how GenAI is impacting RSEs, and the vision RSEs have for their profession in this new technological landscape. 

## Who are Research Software Engineers?
Research Software Engineer is a role that can be defined as: those who regularly use expertise in programming to advance research (US-RSE) or one who combines professional software engineering expertise with an intimate understanding of research (Society of Research Software Engineering). As long as software has been part of the research enterprise, so have RSEs. In the last 15 years, RSEs have been formally organized through dozens of international, national, regional, and local associations and groups. These RSE communities provide a foundation of support, mentoring, resource sharing, and advocacy to their membership and beyond.

## RSE work is people work
Sustainable research software rises from collaboration, and RSEs are the linchpin: they bridge disciplines, turn research needs into working systems, and mentor colleagues in sound computational practices. These human roles – translation, coordination, and trust-building – are not functions GenAI can adequately replace. Organisations seeking to replace RSE collaboration with GenAI should expect lower quality outputs and loss of institutional knowledge. 

RSEs recognize the value in the work of others. Research is a team effort, and one that builds on the contributions of many others to progress. Even though much of our work is distributed under open source licenses, we understand the value of credit and attribution to ensure that people are attracted to and retained in this career. GenAI tool developers should properly attribute the datasets they have used to train their models, to recognise that they are built on the work of others, and to provide greater transparency over the provenance of the models.

## GenAI is a tool, not a substitute for human judgment 
Like many tools RSEs use in their work, GenAI can be powerful if applied responsibly and thoughtfully. Current experience with GenAI suggests that these technologies are helpful in an assistive capacity, but if applied to complex, multifaceted problems, they are often found lacking. RSEs and researchers should own technical decisions and be trusted to select and integrate technologies that best advance the organization’s mission and maintain research integrity. Wherever and however GenAI tools are used, there must be a human in the loop who has the expertise to evaluate, contextualize, and remedy the results. RSEs must take ownership for GenAI being used responsibly in their work.

## Sustainability and transparency matter more than ever
Research is an iterative process that relies not only on findings published across generations, but also on the methods and infrastructure that produce them. Decisions about the use of GenAI in research projects should be clearly documented, decided in advance, and incorporate the views of the RSEs involved. RSEs should clearly describe how GenAI was used in their software development processes. 

As these methods and infrastructure grow more complex and computational, we must ensure their development is reproducible to maximize research impact. The introduction of GenAI into the research process raises serious new questions about how it fits within best practices for reproducible research. The opaque nature of GenAI tools makes it more important than ever to transparently test and validate GenAI outputs and include peer-review of code and other project artifacts as research outputs. RSEs should also be involved in the creation of policies and norms that support high-quality research software. Adoption of GenAI for research software engineering should proceed cautiously and be tethered to a redoubling of effort around reproducibility best practices. 

## RSEs are well positioned to close knowledge gaps 
The emergence of GenAI has disrupted many sectors, including the RSE sector. The potential for GenAI tools to radically change the RSE workplace is apparent, but the rapid development of GenAI tools and methods has made it difficult for RSEs to evaluate and build best practices for using GenAI. Research software engineering and the broader research enterprise must provide time and resources that allow RSEs to build tailored training, best practices, and policies (governmental, institutional, community) for applying GenAI to the RSE work environment. GenAI is not a substitute for developing and honing critical RSE skills and knowledge, nor is it a replacement for high quality training and mentorship. RSE communities provide a rich environment in which to close knowledge gaps, determine the suitability of incorporating GenAI into projects, and build mentorship and professional development opportunities.  

## Agility in a changing landscape is essential
The change in capabilities, expectations and understanding of GenAI has been rapid, and development is likely to continue apace for the foreseeable future. As RSEs working at the forefront of research and technology, we recognise the need to adapt, adjust and develop as the situation changes. Agility sits at the heart of software engineering and Research Software Engineers are best placed to steer their position in the changing research landscape as technologies develop.

## Conclusion
The work of Research Software Engineers is critical to the success of modern research across all sectors. With the emergence of GenAI, RSEs face the challenge of evaluating and integrating the technology into a complex ecosystem of research infrastructure. We must ensure that GenAI is used responsibly and in a way compatible with the ethos of the modern, open, computational research enterprise. RSEs are critical to successfully integrating GenAI into research infrastructures, and RSE communities will provide a foundation for advocacy, resource sharing, and mentoring.

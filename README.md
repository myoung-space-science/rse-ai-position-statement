## Position statement on AI in the RSE workplace

Over a four month period, we engaged with over 100 research software engineers (RSEs) at a number of community events (SciPy, RSECon 25, US-RSE 2025, Supercomputing 2025) to better understand the impacts of Generative AI (GenAI) on the work of Research Software Engineers (RSEs). Through these conversations we have seen an interest from the RSE community to make a public statement about how GenAI is impacting RSEs and the vision that RSEs have for their profession in this new technological landscape. 

This position statement was developed based on the input of RSEs at these events and compiled by event organizers at the Alliance for Data Science and AI (ADSA), the US Research Software Engineer Association (US-RSE), UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), Institute of Computing for Climate Science (ICCS), University College London (UCL), and generously supported by Schmidt Sciences.

If you are interested in reviewing the position statement and signing it once it is finalized, you're in the right place!
